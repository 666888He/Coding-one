Coding one "planetary defense line"

Design concept of "planetary defense line"
The earth, a blue and great planet, is our home for human survival. The earth not only breeds human beings, but also provides them with various material bases for the development of civilization. On the contrary, human survival and activities are inseparable from the earth. All kinds of resources needed for human development and progress come from the earth. However, due to human greed, resources are constantly being reclamation and occupation, leading to the beginning of the disease of the blue planet. According to research, air pollution, glacier melting and mountain fire flooding are the biggest challenges facing the earth in recent years, which have seriously damaged the earth's ecosystem and human living environment.

The ball of the main body is the earth. The color is not the blue of the earth, but gray, which means that our earth has been scarred and damaged wantonly by human beings.

The hexagonal frame with flame texture represents that the spread of mountain fire is sweeping the ecology of all continents on the earth. Take the Amazon forest fire in 2019 as an example. Although the weather is extremely dry and wild fires are common in the dry season of Amazon, the fire in 2019 is 83% larger than that in 2018. Many cities in Brazil suddenly plunged into darkness due to smoke. Smoke and dust enveloped the whole world, and even the downpour was full of burning ashes. The Brazilian tropical rainforest contributes nearly 20% of the world's oxygen, but the earth has been burning for more than half a month, resulting in a huge loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the power of mountain fire is undoubtedly a huge disaster for the earth.

Light blue cubes running through the center of the Earth represent meltwater from melting ice and snow from glaciers. Global surface warming has directly led to sea level rise, and this change is a slow-onset that is not easily noticed by people in a short period of time, so most people choose to ignore sea level rise. But the fact is that without preventive measures and mitigation policies, the sea level will continue to rise, and some island countries and coastal cities may be in danger of being submerged.

The yellow outer space represents the smoke and dust in the air pollution. The harm of air pollution to human body is mainly manifested as respiratory diseases. The harm to nature can suppress the physiological mechanism of plants, stunt their growth, weaken their resistance to diseases and pests, and even kill them. Therefore, there is a great threat to human society and natural ecosystems.

This work applies three.js, shaders, and external Mp3 sound files, etc. After building the basic model, adjust the corresponding rotation center and position, and assign the corresponding material map.

In short, I designed this interactive work of "planetary defense line" to reflect several unavoidable problems faced by our human beings in the form of abstract and conceptual visual expression. I would also like to appeal to all mankind to jointly guard our homeland and do not wait until our lose it to know regret.
